1.Name the configuration file which holds HDFS tuning parameters

hdfs-site.xml
2.Name the parameter that controls the replication factor in HDFS:

dfs.replication
3.Check answers that apply when replication is lowered

HDFS is less robust
less likely make data local to more workers
more space
4.Check answers that apply when NameNode fails to receive heartbeat from a DataNode

DataNode is marked dead
No new I/O is sent to particular DataNode that missed heartbeat check
Blocks below replication factor are re-replicated on other DataNodes
5.How is data corruption mitigated in HDFS

checksums are computed on file creation and stored in HDFS namespace for verification when data is retrieved.
